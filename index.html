<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
<img id="profileimage" src="profile-pic.jpg">
 <h2>I'm LINDSEY ROGERS COOK.</h2>


<p>I'm a coder journalist with a passion for creating user-centered experiences, beautiful data visualizations and interactive stories. I work as the data editor at <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine">U.S. News & World Report.</a> I'm also pursuing my masters in computer science at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I adjunct at American University, where I teach a class in data visualization.</p>

<h3>I'm Proud Of:</h3>

<p><span ><a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/the-chase
">The Chase:</a></span> Created a hub for our election content that ranks candidates based on polling data, records campaign trips to early primary states and using a treemap of the candidates as navigation. The project is iterative — I'm in constant discussions with our editors and political team about how to make the project more useful to our readers. I led our graphics team in creating <a href='http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/09/17/how-the-republican-candidates-performed-in-the-second-debate-in-1-gif'>innovative approaches</a> to the 2016 election in a variety of timeframes. </p>

<p><span ><a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/health-care-index/articles/2015/05/07/us-news-health-care-index?int=a58009
">U.S. News Health Care Index</a></span> and <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/stem-index/articles/2015/06/29/the-2015-us-news-raytheon-stem-index?int=9a2908"><span >STEM Index:</a></span> Designed and developed a template for USN index projects that allows for quick creation of exploratory data dashboards in a new full-width CMS template. Worked with multiple stakeholders across the IT, Design, Data and News departments to transform projects once communicated with a simple one-line Excel chart into an immersive D3 visualization that allows the user to explore thousands of raw and indexed data points. </p>

<p><span ><a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/">The Data Mine Blog:</a></span> Recently, I created a graphic that utilizes vertical scroll to communicate the <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/08/28/no-one-knows-how-many-people-died-in-katrina">death toll of Hurricane Katrina.</a> I also covered a variety of topics through data such as the <a href='http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/08/25/millennials-like-some-majors-more-than-their-baby-boomer-parents'>popularity of majors</a> in college education, the <a href='http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/08/19/the-heroin-epidemic-in-9-graphs'>heroin epidemic,</a> <a href='http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/08/13/hate-math-then-your-children-will-too'>math anxiety,</a> the <a href='http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/07/31/professional-sports-games-fall-into-7-categories-71-stories'>predictable arcs</a> of sports games, <a href='http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/06/25/will-we-all-shut-up-about-obamacare-now-probably-not'>health care</a> reform, <a href='http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/06/23/the-nra-should-send-obama-a-thank-you-card'>gun control</a> and the possibility of <a href='http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/03/27/is-2016-the-right-year-for-tax-reform'>tax reform</a> as a potentially central issue in the 2016 election.</p>

<p><span ><a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/09/17/pentagon-1033-program-sends-surplus-military-gear-to-us-borders
">1033 Program Data:</a></span> Worked with USN political reporter on analysis of 1033 program data on release of military equipment, finding that much of the equipment went to the border with Mexico. Also wrote stories on the <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/09/16/more-transparency-better-data-needed-on-pentagons-1033-program"> quality of the data,</a> which <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/08/25/which-states-use-the-defense-departments-1033-program-more">states use the program</a> more and <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/08/25/ignore-what-you-see-on-tv-the-1033-program-is-actually-pretty-boring">non-military items</a> in the program. </p>

<p>Race Gaps in <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/01/05/black-americans-have-fewer-years-to-live-heres-why">Health,</a> <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2015/01/28/us-education-still-separate-and-unequal">Education</a> and <a href="http://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/data-mine/2014/12/11/no-justice-is-not-colorblind">Criminal Justice:</a> Wrote data-driven series analyzing gaps between white and black Americans.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/local/how-capital-bikeshare-has-grown/">How Capital Bikeshare Has Grown:</a> Analyzed data on Capital Bikeshare trips and visualized using QGIS, Tilemill and D3 while interning at The Washington Post.</p>

<p><a href="http://lindseycook.io/ProjectSpiritAnimal/">Project Spirit Animal</a> and <a href="http://carffeine.mynmi.net/">Carffeine:</a> Two team-created mobile prototypes I created while at University of Georgia. I served as developer for both projects which followed UX processes — including gathering requirements from stakeholders, mockups, prototyping and testing using a user script of actions.</p>

<p><a href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/learning/journalism-students-and-cs/">Why Journalism Students Don't Learn CS:</a> Created IRB-approved research project as an AP-Google Scholar through ONA. The project surveyed journalism and computer science students to determine what barriers existed between the departments. In addition to the post above, I co-authored <a href="http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2677263&dl=ACM&coll=DL">an academic paper</a> on lessons learned in the CS/journalism course I co-designed and co-taught, presented <a href="http://lindseyrogerscook.tumblr.com/post/86652686568/computer-science-preliminary-findings-and">a report to the diversity committee</a> of UGA's computer science department with recommendations and gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9obvfDAKEM&list=FLoVsLfArILsYDyHhf18jNMg&index=1">a TEDx talk</a> about the confidence gap and how my attitude toward feminism changed as a result of my research.
